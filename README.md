# LeetCode 75 Study Plan – Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to problems from the **LeetCode 75 Study Plan**:  
https://leetcode.com/studyplan/leetcode-75/

I created this repo as part of my learning journey to improve **problem solving, clarity of thinking, and writing clean code**.

## About the solutions
- Each problem is solved with a focus on simplicity and correctness  
- I prioritize clear logic over unnecessary complexity  
- Every solution includes **time and space complexity analysis**  
- Some problems may include more than one approach when helpful  

## Purpose
- Practice data structures and algorithms in a structured way  
- Prepare for technical interviews  
- Track my progress and understanding over time  

## Notes
- Solutions are written for learning and revision  
- This repository is updated as I move through the study plan
